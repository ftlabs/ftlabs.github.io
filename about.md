FT Labs is a small team at the [Financial Times](http://www.ft.com), striving to reach and engage readers with the worldâ€™s finest journalism, by looking for gaps, opportunities, concerns, and the unknown.

We are helping prepare for new technologies, ideas, and behaviours, which might help or hinder.

Along the way we are looking to create and take advantage of collaborations between teams within the FT as well as externally.

You can catch up with us virtually on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/ftlabs) and [GitHub](http://github.com/ftlabs).

## Some history

The [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com) is an English-language daily newspaper, [founded in 1888](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Times) (here's a nice [pictorial timeline](http://aboutus.ft.com/files/2010/09/FThistory.jpg)).

In January 2012, Assanka, [the web and application development company acquired by the Financial Times](http://aboutus.ft.com/2012/04/26/fts-assanka-rebrands-as-ft-labs/), was officially rebranded as [FT Labs](/2012/01/strike-me-pink-assanka-and-the-ft/).

From 2012 to 2015, pieces of this original FT Labs group split off into separate products and teams, merging into the larger FT organisation. These include:

* [Origami](http://origami.ft.com)
* [Web App](https://app.ft.com)
* Blogs
* [Alphaville](https://ftalphaville.ft.com/)
* [MBA Rankings](http://rankings.ft.com/businessschoolrankings/rankings)
* and a long tail of smaller products

Since January 2015, FT Labs (2.0) been the small R&D team within the FT as described above, rising from the ashes of the former inhabitants of the brand name.

Since July 2015, after a long stint as part of [Pearson](https://www.pearson.com/uk/), the FT has been part of [Nikkei](http://www.nikkei.com/), a Japanese financial publishing company, and publisher of the respected Nikkei 225 stock index.
