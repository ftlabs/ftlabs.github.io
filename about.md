FT Labs is a small team at the [Financial Times](http://www.ft.com), striving to reach and engage readers with the worldâ€™s finest journalism, by looking for gaps, opportunities, concerns, and the unknown.

We are helping prepare for new technologies, ideas, and behaviours, which might help or hinder.

Along the way we are looking to create and take advantage of collaborations between teams within the FT as well as externally.

Since July 2015, the FT has been part of [Nikkei](http://www.nikkei.com/), a Japanese financial publishing company, and publisher of the respected Nikkei 225 stock index.

You can catch up with us virtually on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/ftlabs) and [GitHub](http://github.com/ftlabs).
