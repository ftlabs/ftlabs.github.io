You will also often see FT engineers speaking at conferences including Velocity, Edge, CSSConf, Overtheair, Web Directions, and Full Frontal.

<h2>Application process</h2>
<p>Each job ad lists a hiring manager to email if you would like to apply. For engineering roles, there is then an opportunity to have a crack at our (exciting and interesting!) online skills assessment to evaluate your competencies in our key skill areas. If you&#8217;re successful you will be invited to a remote interview over a video chat, where you&#8217;ll normally do some collaborative problem solving with an existing member of our team.  If the video interview is successful we&#8217;ll invite you to come and see us at our office in London for a final interview.</p>
<p>The best candidates show initiative by applying to us directly.  We do work with recruitment agents for positions at FT, but only those on our preferred suppliers list.</p>
<h2>Work ethic</h2>
<p>To fit in with our team you must be highly motivated, able to manage your own schedule effectively but proactively integrate and collaborate with the rest of the team. The following list summarises some of the qualities that we&#8217;re looking for in candidates for any position:</p>
<ul>
<li>Self-motivating</li>
<li>Proactive in team participation</li>
<li>Respect and support for your colleagues</li>
<li>Independence</li>
<li>Very high standard of written English</li>
<li>Co-operative and friendly attitude to colleagues, management and clients</li>
<li>Excellent timekeeping</li>
</ul>
<p>Here&#8217;s how we rate on the <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html', 'Joel test');">Joel test</a>, which several people have asked us to complete:</p>
<ol>
<li>Do you use source control?<br />
Yes, of course. We use <a href="http://git-scm.com/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://git-scm.com/', 'Git');">Git</a> universally, and most projects have web access via Github or Bitbucket Server.</li>
<li>Can you make a build in one step?<br />
Some of our applications include a build step, some don&#8217;t.  Where they do, yes, you can usually make a build in one step.</li>
<li>Do you make daily builds?<br />
Normally dozens of times a day.</li>
<li>Do you have a bug database?<br />
We have a comprehensive suite of tools for capturing user reports, automatically tracking and aggregating run time errors on production systems, alerting continuous integration test failures and dealing with QA feedback from internal test engineers.  We use a combination of home grown tools, <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://jenkins-ci.org/', 'Jenkins');">Jenkins</a>, <a href="http://www.splunk.com" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.splunk.com', 'Splunk');">Splunk</a> and <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira', 'JIRA');">JIRA</a>.</li>
<li>Do you fix bugs before writing new code?<br />
Trivial bugs are fixed straight away, more complex bugs are logged as they&#8217;re found and then planned into future sprints.</li>
<li>Do you have an up-to-date schedule?<br />
Yes, though how far into the future that goes depends on the agility of the project.</li>
<li>Do you have a spec?<br />
Some teams use <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira', 'JIRA');">JIRA</a>, an agile task tracker, to plan sprints and feature requirements.  Others use similar tools.</li>
<li>Do programmers have quiet working conditions?<br />
We have a purpose built office designed to our requirements, and we try to keep distractions to a minimum.  Desks are arranged in open plan.</li>
<li>Do you use the best tools money can buy?<br />
Equipment costs a lot less than time. We make sure our staff are never unproductive because they don&#8217;t have the tools to do the job. That said we&#8217;re not into buying flashy kit or software just for the sake of it.</li>
<li>Do you have testers?<br />
Yes.</li>
<li>Do new candidates write code during their interview?<br />
Yes (if you do more than one interview you will write code in at least one of them).</li>
<li>Do you do hallway usability testing?<br />
Yes.</li>
</ol>

<h2>The right opportunity</h2>
<p>Working at FT is always a learning experience. We encourage staff to get involved in individual advancement and professional certification programmes, and will sponsor certification exams where appropriate. Our team is on the cutting edge of web development and we want it to stay there.</p>
<p>We are keen to try and maximise the value of your time and will design a schedule around your preferred working style, whether you need to accommodate a school or nursery run, avoid busy commute periods, a gym or sports club schedule, we&#8217;ll do our best to accommodate you.</p>
<h2>The right person</h2>
<p>FT is an equal opportunities employer. In recruiting staff we are concerned with nothing other than the ability of the person to do the job, subject to the qualities outlined above. If you are employed to work in our London office, you will be required to maintain an appropriate (but very informal) dress code.</p>
<p>The FT is proud of having a diverse workforce across departments. In technology, we still have a way to go in meeting our goal of having a diverse team.  We are committed to providing an environment that is welcoming, trusting and respectful to all staff, including those currently underrepresented in the technology industry. Different voices can lead to different solutions and thus better opportunities &#8211; even for the most experienced engineers &#8211; to learn.</p>
<p>We value having a balanced team in which everyone benefits from a collaborative and supportive culture and opportunities to expand their career.</p>
<h2>The next step</h2>
<p>If you would like to be considered, please send an email to the hiring manager listed on the job ad you are interested in.  You&#8217;ll then go through our <a href="../index.html%3Fp=1521.html" title="Application and interview process">standard recruitment process</a>.</p>
