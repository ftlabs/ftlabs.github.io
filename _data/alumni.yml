 This is a collection of the many great folk
 who have been part of the various incarnations
 of FT Labs.

 The list is not yet complete,
 and we are always happy to add anyone we overlooked.

 The only mandatory field for a person is their name.

 Beware dangling spaces.

 The current FT Labs team is known as FT Labs 2.0,
 to differentiate it from FT Labs (1.0),
 which is what Assanka became.

 ex2point0 folk are listed as permies/short termers, then recency.
 ex1point0 folk are listed alphabetically.
