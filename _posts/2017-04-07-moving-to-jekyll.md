A brief note to indicate we have ported the FT Labs blog from Wordpress to Jekyll.

## Why?

A variety reasons, including

* We had no immediately available Wordpress skills (nor did we particularly want any).
* Wordpress, whilst being largely fine, involved too much peripheral noise.
* Jekyll gives us easy access to all parts of the blog.
* By using our GitHub accounts for Jekyll admin access, we can remove the need to maintain accounts in Wordpress.
* Increased visibility of the blog and [its workings](https://github.com/ftlabs/ftlabs.github.io) to FT tech people.
* We can use the lovely GitHub Pages as a host, and remove another system from the list of Things We Have To Worry About (tm).
* Jekyll+Liquid is fun.

## Gotchas

* We have striven to persist the permalinks of the old FT Labs posts.
* We are slowly teasing out all the WordPress-isms which resulted from the initial, fairly brutal, [recursive web-suck](http://www.krazyworks.com/wget-examples-and-scripts/)
* Does not yet seem to have lead to a marked increase in the rate at which we write new posts, so may simply have been a fine example of [Yak Shaving](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yak_shaving).
