<p><strong>This post was originally made on the Assanka blog.  Assanka was acquired by the Financial Times in January 2012, and became what is now FT Labs.  <a href="/about">Learn more</a>.</strong></p>
<p>Assanka is delighted to announce that FT Alphaville has won <strong>Best Business Blog</strong> at the prestigious 2007 EPpy awards in Miami, Florida.  FT Alphaville is developed, maintained and hosted by Assanka for the Financial Times, and features up to the second, cutting edge business journalism from a dedicated editorial team based in London and Tokyo.</p>
<p>Just seven months old, Alphaville appeared at the awards for the first time, facing stiff competition from the two respected BusinessWeek blogs &#8220;Hot Property&#8221; and &#8220;Brand New Day&#8221;.  With a growing audience increasingly participating on the site and technology that reaches out to visitors through a daily email and live chat, Alphaville wowed the judges and took the title.</p>
<p>Assanka is proud to be associated with Alphaville and we look forward to introducing further innovative features in the months to come.  As it stands Alphaville is a great example of using technology to generate and deliver relevant, high-quality information to readers faster and fresher than ever before.  The next generation of Alphaville features will build on this success and cement the site&#8217;s reputation as the investor&#8217;s first choice for market news and opinion.  In a world where every second counts, Alphaville always has the story.</p>

<p>Assanka director Robert Shilston comments:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;FT Alphaville&#8217;s recent success is brilliant news for everyone &#8211; it confirms our belief that the future of journalism is in the real-time delivery of stories, not the daily press cycle we&#8217;ve been used to in the past.  Assanka&#8217;s technology ensures that the FT Alphaville site is always up-to-date, without needing visitors to refresh their screen, and Markets Live takes this to the extreme &#8212; a live chat on the blog &#8212; and we know the public like it.  We&#8217;re delighted that our technology has helped the FT with their recent award&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Having recovered from a few celebratory glasses of champagne on the flight back to London, Alphaville&#8217;s editor Paul Murphy is enthused by the partnership:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve cracked the mould with Alphaville and as a key partner Assanka is vital to the success.  We value their insight and with a complex site like Alphaville it&#8217;s critical that we have partners willing to go that bit further to keep the wheels on the track.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Other winners included BBC News Online, ESPN, The New York Times and CNN.  Since 1996, the EPpy Awards has honored the best new media services from the newspaper industry.
